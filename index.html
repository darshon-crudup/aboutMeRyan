    Hello, my name is Ryan Apodaca. I currently live in Honolulu, Hawaii, with my wife who is stationed here playing
    flute for the Navy band. We met when I played saxophone in the USMC. The USMC has been my primary place of
    employment, other than odd jobs and gigs. I received my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience and Philosophy from
    Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
